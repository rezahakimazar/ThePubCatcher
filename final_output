OBJECTIVE: Suicide ideation and suicide attempts are prevalent in Farsi speaking 
populations. The present study aimed at validating the Farsi version of the 
Suicide Ideation and Behavior Scale (SIBS).
METHODS: Reliability and validity of the Farsi version of the SIBS were 
established in a highly burdened Afghan student sample (N = 279). Internal 
consistency, convergent and discriminant validity were investigated, and 
confirmatory factor analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: The Farsi version of the SIBS was shown to have a unidimensional 
structure with excellent internal consistency, as well as good convergent and 
divergent validity.
DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the SIBS is a brief, reliable, and valid 
measure of current suicidal ideation and behavior that can be used in Farsi 
speaking populations.
